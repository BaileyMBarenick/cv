### About This Site

This website serves as both a professional CV and a blog platform for sharing insights about biotechnology research, data analysis, and scientific computing.

It was originally built with Jekyll and converted to [Quarto](https://quarto.org) for its native support for scientific publishing, R/Python code execution, and modern responsive themes. Deployment is fully automated via GitHub Actions — every push to the `main` branch triggers a rebuild and publishes the rendered site to GitHub Pages.

**Technology stack:**

- **Framework**: Quarto
- **Theme**: Sandstone (warm palette customised via CSS)
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (`gh-pages` branch)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

---

### Updating This Site

**CV** — edit `index.qmd` and push to `main`.

**Blog posts** — create a new folder under `posts/` following the `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title` convention, add an `index.qmd` with the front matter below, and push:

```yaml
---
title: "Post Title"
author: "Bailey M. Barenick"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
categories: [category1, category2]
draft: false
---
```

**Local preview** (requires [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) installed):

```bash
quarto preview
```
