## Introduction

Welcome to my new website! This post documents the process of building this site using [Quarto](https://quarto.org), a modern open-source scientific and technical publishing system. The transition from Jekyll to Quarto represents a significant upgrade in functionality and flexibility, particularly for someone working at the intersection of biotechnology and data science.

## Why Quarto?

When I decided to rebuild my professional website, I had several requirements:

- **Scientific publishing capabilities**: As a biotechnology graduate student working with data analysis in R, I need a platform that can seamlessly integrate code, visualizations, and narrative text
- **Modern, professional appearance**: A clean, responsive design suitable for both CV presentation and blogging
- **Blog functionality**: The ability to share research insights, methodologies, and tutorials
- **Easy maintenance**: Simple content management without complex build processes
- **Automated deployment**: Push changes to GitHub and have the site automatically update

Quarto checks all these boxes and more. Built by the creators of RStudio, Quarto is designed specifically for technical and scientific communication, supporting R, Python, Julia, and Observable JS.

## The Conversion Process

### From Jekyll to Quarto

The original site was built with Jekyll using the Tactile theme. While Jekyll served its purpose for a static CV, Quarto offers several advantages:

1. **Native support for computational content**: I can embed R code, Python scripts, and interactive visualizations directly in posts
2. **Better scientific formatting**: Built-in support for citations, cross-references, equations, and figures
3. **Unified workflow**: The same tool works for websites, blogs, books, presentations, and academic papers
4. **Modern themes**: Professional, responsive themes optimized for technical content

The conversion involved:

- Creating a `_quarto.yml` configuration file with site metadata and navigation structure
- Converting `index.md` to `index.qmd` with Quarto-specific YAML front matter
- Setting up the blog structure with a posts directory
- Configuring GitHub Actions for automated deployment

### Site Structure

The Quarto website is organized as follows:

```
cv/
├── _quarto.yml           # Main configuration
├── index.qmd             # CV homepage
├── blog.qmd              # Blog listing page
├── styles.css            # Custom styling
└── posts/                # Blog posts directory
    └── 2026-02-17-building-this-site/
        └── index.qmd     # This post!
```

Each blog post lives in its own dated directory, making it easy to include post-specific images, data files, or other assets.

### Configuration Highlights

The `_quarto.yml` file defines the entire website structure:

```yaml
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: _site

website:
  title: "Bailey M. Barenick"
  navbar:
    left:
      - text: "Home"
        href: index.qmd
      - text: "Blog"
        href: blog.qmd

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    toc: true
```

I chose the **Cosmo** theme for its professional appearance and excellent readability. The table of contents feature is particularly useful for navigating the CV sections.

### Setting Up the Blog

The blog functionality in Quarto is remarkably straightforward. The `blog.qmd` file contains a simple listing configuration:

```yaml
---
title: "Blog"
listing:
  contents: posts
  sort: "date desc"
  type: default
  categories: true
---
```

This automatically generates a blog listing page that displays all posts from the `posts/` directory, sorted by date, with category tags and reading time estimates.

## GitHub Actions Deployment

One of the most powerful features of this setup is automated deployment via GitHub Actions. Every time I push changes to the main branch, the site is automatically rebuilt and published to GitHub Pages.

The workflow file (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) uses official Quarto actions:

```yaml
name: Publish Quarto Website

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2
      - uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2
        with:
          target: gh-pages
```

This three-step process checks out the repository, sets up Quarto, and publishes the rendered site to the `gh-pages` branch. No manual building or deployment needed!

## What's Next?

Now that the infrastructure is in place, I'm excited to share content about:

- **Maize genetics research**: Updates from the Chopra Lab on fall armyworm resistance and flavonoid biosynthesis
- **Biotechnology methodologies**: Protocols, techniques, and lessons learned in the lab
- **Data analysis tutorials**: R workflows for analyzing microbial community data and gene expression
- **Scientific visualization**: Creating compelling figures and graphics for research communication
- **Professional development**: Navigating graduate school and the biotechnology industry

## Getting Started with Quarto

If you're interested in building your own site with Quarto, here are some excellent resources:

- [Quarto Official Documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/)
- [Creating a Blog with Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html)
- [GitHub Pages Publishing Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html)
- [Quarto GitHub Actions](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions)

The learning curve is gentle, especially if you're already familiar with Markdown and YAML. For scientists and researchers who work with R or Python, Quarto is a game-changer.

## Conclusion

Building this website with Quarto has been a rewarding experience. The platform provides exactly what I need: a professional CV presentation, blog capabilities, and the potential to share computational work with integrated code and visualizations. The automated deployment through GitHub Actions means I can focus on content rather than infrastructure.

I encourage anyone working in science, technology, or academia to consider Quarto for their professional website. It's free, open-source, and designed specifically for technical communication.

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for more posts on biotechnology, research, and data science!
