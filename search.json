Built by the creators of RStudio, Quarto is designed specifically for technical and scientific communication, supporting R, Python, Julia, and Observable JS."

    "title": "Building This Website with Quarto",
    "section": "The Conversion Process",
    "text": "The Conversion Process\n\nFrom Jekyll to Quarto\nThe original site was built with Jekyll using the Tactile theme. While Jekyll served its purpose for a static CV, Quarto offers several advantages:\n\nNative support for computational content: I can embed R code, Python scripts, and interactive visualizations directly in posts\nBetter scientific formatting: Built-in support for citations, cross-references, equations, and figures\nUnified workflow: The same tool works for websites, blogs, books, presentations, and academic papers\nModern themes: Professional, responsive themes optimized for technical content\n\nThe conversion involved:\n\nCreating a _quarto.yml configuration file with site metadata and navigation structure\nConverting index.md to index.qmd with Quarto-specific YAML front matter\nSetting up the blog structure with a posts directory\nConfiguring GitHub Actions for automated deployment\n\n\n\nSite Structure\nThe Quarto website is organized as follows:\ncv/\n├── _quarto.yml           # Main configuration\n├── index.qmd             # CV homepage\n├── blog.qmd              # Blog listing page\n├── styles.css            # Custom styling\n└── posts/                # Blog posts directory\n    └── 2026-02-17-building-this-site/\n        └── index.qmd     # This post!\nEach blog post lives in its own dated directory, making it easy to include post-specific images, data files, or other assets.\n\n\nConfiguration Highlights\nThe _quarto.yml file defines the entire website structure:\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: _site\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"Bailey M. Barenick\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - text: \"Home\"\n        href: index.qmd\n      - text: \"Blog\"\n        href: blog.qmd\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n    toc: true\nI chose the Cosmo theme for its professional appearance and excellent readability. The table of contents feature is particularly useful for navigating the CV sections.\n\n\nSetting Up the Blog\nThe blog functionality in Quarto is remarkably straightforward. The blog.qmd file contains a simple listing configuration:\n---\ntitle: \"Blog\"\nlisting:\n  contents: posts\n  sort: \"date desc\"\n  type: default\n  categories: true\n---\nThis automatically generates a blog listing page that displays all posts from the posts/ directory, sorted by date, with category tags and reading time estimates."

Every time I push changes to the main branch, the site is automatically rebuilt and published to GitHub Pages.\nThe workflow file (.github/workflows/publish.yml) uses official Quarto actions:\nname: Publish Quarto Website\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [main]\n\njobs:\n  build-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n      - uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n      - uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2\n        with:\n          target: gh-pages\nThis three-step process checks out the repository, sets up Quarto, and publishes the rendered site to the gh-pages branch. No manual building or deployment needed!"
